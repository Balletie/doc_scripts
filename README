doc_scripts

Scripts for building and deploying docs in Pillar format
to GitHub pages. This is meant to be used as submodule
within a repository including a 'doclink_config.ini' file.

Files:

- doclink.py: Creates links to source code within Pillar
  files. See './doclink.py --help' for usage and info.
- build.sh: Build the Pillar build product with links
  linked to source code in the `master` branch of the
  parent repository. Reads from '../doclink_config.ini'
  the options for './doclink.py'.
- deploy.sh: Uses build.sh and deploys to the `gh-pages`
  of the parent repository.-
- example.ini: example template config file for
  '../doclink_config.ini' in the parent repository.
- install_git.sh: Used to install a Git version with
  the git-worktree builtin. Originally meant for use
  with Travis CI, which has an old version of Git.
